📌 COPILOT MASTER PROMPT – COMPLAINT REPORTING SYSTEM
You are a senior full-stack software engineer tasked with designing and implementing a production-ready, real-time Complaint Reporting System.
This is NOT an MVP, NO dummy data, and must be fully functional.
🎯 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
Build a Complaint Reporting System that allows customers to submit complaints through:
QR Code–based web form (smartphone users)
AI Voice Call Assistant (for customers without smartphones)
Administrators manage stations, view complaints, and receive real-time notifications.
🧱 TECH STACK (MANDATORY)
Frontend
Next.js (App Router)
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (for real-time updates)
Backend
Node.js
Express or Fastify
WebSocket (Socket.IO)
REST + real-time communication
Database
Neon PostgreSQL
Prisma ORM (preferred)
AI / Voice
ElevenLabs Voice API for AI voice call assistant
Speech-to-Text + Text-to-Speech integration
Storage
Cloud storage (e.g. S3-compatible) for photo & video evidence
🧩 CORE FEATURES
1️⃣ Landing Page
Public landing page explaining the complaint system
Button to Admin Login
Professional, minimal UI
2️⃣ Authentication
Secure Admin Login
JWT or session-based authentication
Role-based access (Admin only)
3️⃣ Admin Dashboard (Core Panel)
Dashboard Layout
Split view:
Left / Top: Station List
Main Area: Complaint / Report List
Admin Capabilities
✅ Add Station
✅ View Stations
✅ Delete Station
✅ View Complaints per Station
✅ Real-time notifications when a new complaint is submitted
4️⃣ Station Management & QR Code System
When Admin adds a station:
Store station details in PostgreSQL
Automatically generate a unique QR Code
QR Code must:
Encode station ID
Display Station Name visually
Redirect to station-specific complaint form
Each station has its own QR code.
5️⃣ QR Code Complaint Reporting Form (Customer Side)
When customer scans QR code:
⚠️ Mandatory Alert (Before Form)
Display a modal/alert:
“Please note that your name and contact details will be collected for investigation purposes.”
Customer must accept before continuing.
Complaint Form Fields
Full Name
Phone Number
Complaint Category
Complaint Description
Upload Photo or Video Evidence
Auto-linked Station ID (from QR code)
Requirements
Media uploads must be validated
Store evidence securely
Save complaint to PostgreSQL
Trigger real-time admin notification
6️⃣ AI Voice Call Assistant (No Smartphone Users)
Build an AI Voice Complaint Assistant that:
Uses ElevenLabs voice
Allows customers to call a phone number / short code
Guides user step-by-step:
Station name
Customer name
Contact number
Complaint details
Converts voice → text
Saves complaint into the same database
Links complaint to station
Triggers admin notification in real time
The AI must speak clearly, professionally, and politely.
7️⃣ Real-Time System Behavior
Use WebSockets for:
New complaint alerts
Live dashboard updates
Admin sees:
Instant notification badge
New complaint added without page refresh
🗄️ DATABASE DESIGN (REQUIRED TABLES)
Design normalized PostgreSQL schema:
admins
stations
complaints
media_files
notifications
voice_calls
Use proper:
Foreign keys
Indexes
Timestamps
Soft delete where necessary
🔐 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
Input validation (frontend + backend)
Secure file uploads
Auth middleware
Rate limiting for complaint submission
Sanitization against SQL injection & XSS
📦 DELIVERABLES
Generate:
Full backend API
Database schema (Prisma)
Next.js frontend pages
Admin dashboard UI
QR code generation logic
ElevenLabs AI voice integration
Real-time WebSocket implementation
Production-ready folder structure
❌ STRICT RULES
NO dummy data
NO mock APIs
NO MVP shortcuts
MUST be scalable and real-time
MUST run end-to-end
🧠 FINAL INSTRUCTION
Write clean, maintainable, production-grade code with comments where necessary.
Assume this system will be deployed to production and used by real customers.
